# <Challenge 1>
## ------------------------------Description-------------------------------
## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

-GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
-WHEN I view the source code
-THEN I find semantic HTML elements
-WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
-THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
-WHEN I view the icon and image elements
-THEN I find accessible alt attributes
-WHEN I view the heading attributes
-THEN they fall in sequential order
-WHEN I view the title element
-THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Why I did this:
I wanted to push my boundries for optimizing html and CSS docs.
## Problem solved: 
The customers code volume was reduced which reduced loadtime.
## Learning journey:
I learned how to consolidate css selectors under the same property and value set.
